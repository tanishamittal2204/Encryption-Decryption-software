# Encryption-Decryption-software
Our Java-based encryption/decryption program uses the Swing GUI library and password protection to ensure authorized access. Users can input a message to be encrypted or decrypted using either the Caesar or Rail Fence cipher. The resulting message is displayed in a text area, and users can choose to save it to a file.
